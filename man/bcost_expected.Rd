\arguments{
\item{Cf}{Fixed costs of RDT}

\item{Cv}{Variable unit costs of RDT}

\item{n}{RDT sample size}

\item{G}{Reliabilty growth cost}

\item{Cw}{Average cost per warranty claim}

\item{N}{Sales volume}

Overall expected cost
}
\description{
Define the cost function of expected overall cost including the RDT cost, expected reliabiltiy growth (RG) cost and expected warranty services (WS) cost (for binomial RDT design).
